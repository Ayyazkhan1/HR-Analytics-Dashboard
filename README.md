# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Excited to share that the latest HR analytics dashboard with Power BI showing employee retention and growth insights.

I am always looking for ways to leverage data to drive insights and decisions.

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key HR matrices, and allowing us to monitor and analyze employee performance, retention, employee engagement, and more.

Key performance highlights:

▪ Employee job satisfaction rate

▪ Attrition rate by average salary slab

▪ Employee turnover rate 

▪ Attrition by job role 

By visualizing this data, we can be able to identify trends, spot areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to support organization goals.
